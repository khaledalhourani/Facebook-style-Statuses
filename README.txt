what to do:
===========

for now able to enable:

facebook_status module

submodules:

facebook_status_pathauto
facebook_status_tags
facebook_status_activity
facebook_status_comments

known issues at the moment:

facebook_status_comment:
on reply link the comment box shows. (this is a little bit silly, whereas the reply links doesn't make sense IMO anymore)

facebook_status:
when editing a status error after reload it works.

tags view:
after click on conditional argument and save it tags view can be accessed !?!?!?!?
